# Module 5 Challenge


In this study, 249 animals diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors were treated with various drug regimens. The researchers aimed to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatments. Tumor development was observed and measured over a 45-day period. The analysis revealed a balanced ratio of male and female mice, indicating no gender bias in the study. The following conclusions were drawn from the analysis: <br></br>


### Analysis


1) Capomulin and Ramicane treatments exhibited greater effectiveness compared to the other drugs, as evidenced by the boxplot and statistics table. <br></br>


2) The administration of Capomulin to a specific mouse (Mouse ID = "l509") resulted in positive outcomes, with the tumor size decreasing over the study duration. <br></br>


3) The correlation coefficient of 0.84 between mouse weight and average tumor volume suggests a strong tendency for the average tumor size to increase as the weight of the mouse increases. <br></br>
